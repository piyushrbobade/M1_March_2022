I have Created A game of STONE PAPER SISSOR in which I used the function in that I passed two character values one is for computer and another is for user.

Stone Paper Scissor (which is also called Stone Paper Scissor) is a hand game and played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes. The winner of the game is decided as per the below rules:

Stone vs Paper -> Paper wins.
Stone vs Scissor -> Stone wins.
Paper vs Scissor -> Scissor wins.
In this game, the user will be asked to make choice and according to the choice of user and computer and then the result will be displayed along with the choices of both computer and user.
