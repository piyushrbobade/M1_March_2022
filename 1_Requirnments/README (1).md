I have Created A game of ROCK PAPER SISSOR in which I used the function in that I passed two character values one is for computer and another is for user.

Rock Paper Scissor (which is also called Rock Paper Scissor) is a hand game and played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes. The winner of the game is decided as per the below rules:

Rock vs Paper -> Paper wins.
Rock vs Scissor -> Rock wins.
Paper vs Scissor -> Scissor wins.
In this game, the user will be asked to make choice and according to the choice of user and computer and then the result will be displayed along with the choices of both computer and user.
